### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Unfortunately since the first week consisted of onboarding and other activities, I did not have a lot of time to spend trying out the labs that complement this assignment. I worked on the second lab more than the third, but the second assignment was not very helpful or revelant to the project while the third assignment has a lot of similarities to the project. It definitely would've been better for me to focus my time more on the third lab than the second one. When I tried to do the features for both labs I felt unprepared to complete many of the features like using the GIPHY API for the third lab or understanding many of the concepts associated with lab two, which made it difficult to complete/understand. The wording on the labs can also be a bit confusing and ambigious, which makes it hard to understand what the assignment is really asking for. 

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would've like to learn how to properly implement the grid/flex box for this project. I had a difficult time trying to figure out how to do this, and I eventually ran out of time to try to figure it out. I spent a lot of time focusing on the other features that make the website interactive. I also would have like to try some of the stretch features if I had more time. I think it would be interesting to implement a trailer for the users so that they could preview the movies, and also have a description provided with the movies. I would have also liked to make the site look more visually appealing by working on the css more if I had more time.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

This week I did not demo my project, but I got to see some of my peers projects and some of my peers were able to implement stretch features in their projects, which I would like to try to do in my next one. One of my peers had summaries of the movies in their website and another one of my peers had an interesting clear feature in their website where they could clear a certain new of movies instead of clearing the whole movie page. Both of these features were interesting and fun to see, and I would like to try to add something special like this to my next project.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

I would like to give a shoutout to my instructors who were every attentive and helpful with guding me through this project when I had quesitons. I would also like to thank my peers who also helped me during and after class with the assignment by explaining parts that I didn't understand.
